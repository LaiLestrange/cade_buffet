# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end

# EventOption.create!(name: "Bar", description: "Serviço de bebida alcóolica durante o evento")
# EventOption.create!(name: "Decoração", description: "Organização e decoração do espaço do evento")
# EventOption.create!(name: "Valet", description: "Serviço de estacionamento durante o evento")
